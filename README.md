# Pyera
Pyera is a Discord bot that I am aiming toward having most of the functions for a fun, and easy Discord experience.

## Current features available with the bot:
- YouTube music streaming
- Gambling with an economy system (Roulette, Coinflip, and Roll currently available)
- Verifying users to make sure they have required roles to enter the server.
- Menus to get roles after gaining access to the server.
- Moderation commands such as warn, ban, kick, etc.
- Profanity filter to make sure your server stays clean (There is also support for disabling this function for specific channels).

##### Way more features will be developed. If you do have any suggestions, send me a message on Discord: MiniMonty#0701
##### Thank you for your interest!
